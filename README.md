# DAWT
Hi. Start coding the DAWT website today!

Click 'Create New File' at the top of the page.
Then, name it enterpagenamehere.html or anything 
When done, DO NOT commit directly to the master branch.
YOU MUST click the second option and start a new branch with a pull request,
Then we can all discuss the addition and after we agree, we can merge it to master.
