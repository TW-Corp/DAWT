# DAWT
Hi. Start coding the DAWT website today!

Click 'Create New File' at the top of the page.<br>
Then, name it enterpagenamehere.html or anything <br>
When done, <h3>DO NOT:</h3> Commit directly to the master branch.<br>
<h3>YOU MUST:</h3> 
Click the second option and start a new branch with a pull request,<br>
Then we can all discuss the addition and after we agree, we can merge it to master.<br>
Btw, i can see everything you do ;D
